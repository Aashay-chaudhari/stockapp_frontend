This project stems from my deep passion and an insatiable curiosity to tackle the challenge of stock prediction using cutting-edge machine learning algorithms and problem-solving approaches.

I have researched for over 2 years and integrated all functionality and features I've found useful into this application. 

Feature list: 

Next-day predictions: 

Don't let the application's vanilla layout fool you. TradeSense uses complex machine learning algorithms to provide the next day's opening price of a stock. This mainly focuses on day traders
who like to sell options overnight to earn premium decay. 
*NOTE -> Next-day closing price prediction coming soon.

Similar Historic Patterns:

I'm sure you must have come across the phrase "History repeats itself". Well, I am a strong believer in that phrase, especially when it comes to technical analysis of the stock market. We have researched and compared numerous clustering algorithms to come up with the one we have implemented right now. This functionality is intended to give you an idea of how the stock performed in the past when it had a similar chart pattern.

Back Testing:

I understand that blindly trusting a machine to gamble is filled with uncertainty. To alleviate some of the concerns like will the machine learning model perform well on the stock you select,
I have created a back-testing functionality where you can select a stock and see the models' performance on that stock for the last 140 trading sessions. It will also provide you a more comprehensive prediction based on moving averages as well as the ML algorithm.

Advanced Charting:

Even though my main intention for creating this application was to expose layman traders to machine learning-generated signals (BUY/SELL), I have implemented a demo functionality that includes advanced charting, as found in TradingView.

Build Your Own:

This feature allows a user to create his own machine-learning model and train it on a stock of his choice. However, implementation of this functionality requires a LOT of server space allocation, which is not feasible at the current stage of this website. You can expect this functionality once this website transitions from educational to commercial.

I hope you have a good trading session! Cheers.
