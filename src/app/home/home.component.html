            Welcome friends,<br>
            In this software, I have tried to provide users with various price predictions based on different Machine learning models.
            If you're a day trader and are interested only in tomorrow's closing price of a stock, just click on a stock in the watchlist and 
            start your journey. If you are a swing trader and would ike to see the predicted movement of a stock over a period of time, just 
            click on 30 day forecast.<br><br>
    
            Hello fellow Enthusiasts,<br>
            I have tried to give users the chance to understand what effects different hyperparameters have while training the data. So I 
            have developed a <button (click)="goToBuild()">BUILD YOUR OWN!</button> , where you can create custom models.<br>
            You can test these models over past data and get different statistics about your model. <br>
            Have fun, if you have any constructive criticism, please mail to : aashaychaudhari@gmail.com
